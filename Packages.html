It provides functions to make socket handling, message building, validating, parsing and sequence tracking, easier. . * Easy to re-use: you can use the library to build your own abstraction layer on top of this library. . * Decoupling: the interdependency of the main bricks that compose the library is reduced, i.e. the library provides many helpers, but the programmer is not forced to use them. </td></tr>
